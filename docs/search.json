    "text": "Hey there, welcome to my website! My name is Ethan Mathews, and I created this space to showcase my academic work and share a bit of my personal journey. If you have any questions or would like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out through the social links I’ve provided.\nI’m originally from Omaha, Nebraska, but I’ve spent most of the past 15 years in Encinitas, California, a completely different environment that helped shape who I am. I’ve always loved being outdoors, whether at the beach or in the mountains. I grew up playing just about every sport, but the one that stuck with me was rugby, which I played for three out of my four years in high school. I considered playing in college, but at that point, I knew I needed to dedicate myself to academics.\nFast forward to now, I’m graduating from UC Santa Barbara with a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies. I’ve maintained a competitive GPA throughout my academic journey and focused on applying what I learn to real-world issues. My time at UCSB has been about more than just coursework; I’ve developed practical skills, built meaningful relationships with professors and mentors, and sought out opportunities to leverage my education to align with my long-term goals.\nI’m incredibly passionate about water management and sustainability. With an interdisciplinary background, I’m driven to influence environmental policy and help shape a more sustainable future. My next step is applying to UC Berkeley School of Law, where I hope to continue bridging the gap between science, policy, and the communities most affected by environmental challenges."
